# Effectiveness of Separating Highly and Lowly Correlated Data
## Abstract
  In this paper we consider the idea of separating the highly and lowly correlated data and using a functional deep learning model\n
  for a more precise prediction in regression and a lesser mean squared error. While it is observed that this method does not \n
  produce a more better results but it is observed that this technique reduces the number of parameters compared to a regular\n
  dense deep learning model.
